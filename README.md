# Volunteer Odyssey's edition of Calagator

The Calagator tool [is open source and was developed by Portland Rubyists as a community tech calendar](https://github.com/calagator/calagator).  THIS fork of the calendar has been repurposed to provide a semi-public volunteering calendar for Memphis area nonprofit Volunteer Odyssey.

# History

This Calagator fork was put together at [GiveCamp Memphis](http://givecampmemphis.org/) in February 2015 by a team of local technologists.

# Hosting

Hosting was originally provided by Rackspace, managed by GiveCamp staff (Hi Joe!) and is scheduled to be transferred to Volunteer Odyssey.

# Contributing

Please contact Sarah at Volunteer Odyssey or try reaching out to GiveCamp Memphis sponsors.
